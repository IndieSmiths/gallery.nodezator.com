# gallery.nodezator.com

Website wherein to find interesting node packs for the Nodezator desktop app. Or, the official online node pack index/database of the Nodezator project.

We don't host/store your node pack. Instead, we encourage node pack creators to upload their own node packs to free hosting/repository services like GitHub and only add an entry in our website with info and links pointing to it.

This actually has many advantages to node pack creators. By hosting your source on Github, for instance, your code will be...

- hosted for free
- associated with your name/credited to you
- under your complete control: able to receive suggestions and improvements from others as you see fit
- not depend on the availability of our website, since you are hosting the code yourself, so people can always access it

And the entry on https://gallery.nodezator.com will simply serve as an additional way for people to find it. Our node gallery website is also linked on Nodezator's splashscreen, so it is easy for people to find it and, once on the website, find your node pack.

To have an entry pointing to your node pack added to this node gallery/database just submit the relevant info about your node pack [in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd1XceOnzEeaBZcpkkXEFiAVO_5YUbd43sieQUekh1PZ8dm5A/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Alternatively, you can also submit a pull request to this repository. Here's how: in the [index.html](index.html) file, look for a big comment that starts with "Node Pack Card Template", then follow the instructions written there to copy the template and replace the info with info about your node pack.
